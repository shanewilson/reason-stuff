```
git clone https://github.com/chenglou/reason-react-example.git
cd reason-react-example
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run build
```

After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `npm run build` step), open up the nested html files in `src/*` (**no server needed!**). Then modify whichever file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.
